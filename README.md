This repository contains [course notes](Course_Notes.md) from the Coursera MOOC [Using Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases/). This MOOC is the last course in the [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).

This repository is also intended to showcase the work I did while completing this MOOC - My [course completion record](Course_Completion.md) is also included in this repository.
